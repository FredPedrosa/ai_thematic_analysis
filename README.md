A Thematic Analysis powered by AI tools

## Description

This repository contains the code, analyses, and results of the project **"Music Therapy and Intersectionalities: the creation of spaces for collective listening and support among Black women"** [*Musicoterapia e Interseccionalidades: a criação de espaços de escuta e apoio coletivo entre mulheres negras*], developed from applied research in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The study investigated, from an intersectional perspective, how community music therapy can impact the quality of life, emotional well-being, and collective empowerment of Black women, using mixed methods and artificial intelligence techniques for qualitative and quantitative data analysis. This repository provides the code for AI-assisted thematic analysis.

## Objectives

- Investigate the effects of community music therapy interventions on the quality of life of Black women.
- Understand, from an intersectional approach, how experiences of oppression (racism, sexism, class inequality) affect the mental health of these women.
- Explore the potential of music as a tool for emotional expression, empowerment, and the construction of mutual support.

## Steps and Software

**Thematic analysis:**
- Session transcription (TurboScribe)
- Thematic analysis based on Braun & Clarke (2006), supported by AI tools (Voyant Tools, requalify.ai, K-means++, LDA, Meta-Llama 3.1)

## Main Results

**Qualitative:** Three major themes emerged from the sessions:

1. **Experiences of Racism and Prejudice:** Reports of discrimination and its emotional and identity impacts.
2. **Music as a Space for Connection and Expression:** Music promoted emotional expression, reframing of experiences, and group strengthening.
3. **The Importance of Community and Mutual Support:** The group became a safe space for sharing, solidarity, and building belonging.
